# P16Semaphore

This repository houses an attempt to build a semaphore, using the P16 toolkit. A description of this project can be found within the file ac_202324v_proj_v1.1.pdf, along with an ASM chart that describes the described flow of the program. The latter can be found within the files aptly named ASM_Chart:
- ASM_Chart.drawio houses the schematics of the chart
- ASM_Chart.png houses the same schematics, exported to an image format
